# DatabookRepo

Welcome to my data repository! <br/> For the last months, I have been working a lot with exploratory data analysis on the Brazilian reality (socioeconomic and environmental), country profiles, and greenhouses gases emissions. Although every data available here is public, I hope I can help you by displaying it in a clean and more organized format. This is a repository with 54 datasets  <br/>
I have prepared a complete data description document with data sources, tips, and alerts. This might be useful (and save a lot of time) especially when dealing with a bulk of GHG inventories and its methodological details. Also, these datasets might be useful to work with Brazilian numbers. Every data source is linked on the document below. <br/>

You can find all 54 cleaned datasets just [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjVW0s-wFcYmhYNcpRwg-rKzRyQI_A?e=qiRv0b). <br/>
Also, you can see every dataset coluns description [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjVW0s-wFcYmhYQUfK_isaDDRLsApw?e=Yw3XB0). <br/>
